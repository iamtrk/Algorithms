Version based Optimistic locking 

Quadtree 

Cache miss attack
  - Short TTL for null keys
  - Bloom filters
  
 Register(0.3ns) < L1 Cache(1ns) < L2 Cache(3ns) < L3 Cache(13ns) < RAM(120ns)  < SSD(50-150us) < HDD (1-10ms)
 
 IO Multiplexing & Single threaded read/write (Redis)
 
 Exactly once = At least once (Through retrial) + At most once (Through Idempotency)
 
 Erasure coding for S3 like Object storage
